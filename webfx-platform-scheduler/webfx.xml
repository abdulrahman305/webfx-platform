        Cross-platform Scheduler API for scheduling non-UI tasks{@javadoc
        (see {@link dev.webfx.platform.scheduler.Scheduler Scheduler})}.
        The GWT implementation is indirectly provided by the UiScheduler API (an extension of the Scheduler API with
        additional methods for UI tasks), because there is no distinction in terms of implementation between these 2
        APIs for the browser (due to its mono-thread nature).
